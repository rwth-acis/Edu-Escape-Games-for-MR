# Educational Escape Games for Mixed Reality
This project includes two Educational Mixed Reality Escape Games called _Lost in Space_ and _The Cell_. Educational Mixed Reality Escape Games are riddle-based games where the player has to solve some educational riddles to escape from a room he is locked in. The Mixed Reality technology (Augement Reality by HoloLens) is used to project the necessary game objects into the user's room. Thereby, Educational Mixed Reality Escape Games become a flexible and easy to prepare learning tool.
